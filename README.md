# Project Title

This is to solve an itch/need I have. I wanted a small memory footprint Maven
repo manager. I also don't need a lot of the features other repo managers have.
I want to have the configuration easily under source control as well.

## Getting Started

As of now, this is being built on MacOSX. Other platforms will be tested, but
nothing as of yet.

### Prerequisites

Nothing is known of any additional libraries/dependencies.

```
gcc main.c thread_serve.c
```

### Installing

No installation yet, just build it.
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
gcc main.c thread_serve.c -o wrench
```

And repeat

```
./wrench -r /some/directory/path
```

Then use curl to test it

```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/filename
```

## Running the tests

Sniff sniff, no tests. I'm still figuring out other things.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
